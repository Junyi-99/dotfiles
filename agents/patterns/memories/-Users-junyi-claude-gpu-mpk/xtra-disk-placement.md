On the NUS xtra GPU servers (xtrah100, xtrah200, xtraa100 .ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg), when /home or / is short on space, check /disk* and /ssd* mounts, create /disk*/junyi or /ssd*/junyi, and put envs/models/data there.

**Why:** xtrah200 root was 99% full (102G free) on 2026-10-15; user pointed to these extra disks.
**How to apply:** Before installing envs or downloading weights on these hosts, run `df -h /disk* /ssd*` and pick the emptiest; tell subagents to do the same.
