# Dotfiles

> [!TIP]
> There isn’t a one-size-fits-all configuration file. You should explore dotfiles shared by others and continuously build your own personalized dotfile.

## Features
- **out-of-the-box**
- **minimal side effects**
  - most operations happen in `~/.oh-my-dotfiles`
  - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to `~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/`, so XDG-aware tools (tmux, neovim, etc.) read configs directly from the repo
  - third-party binaries will be downloaded into `~/.oh-my-dotfiles/bin` or `~/.oh-my-dotfiles/deps` (See [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html))
- neovim
  - AI assistant ([copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim))
  - lsp + lsp-manager ([mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim))
  - plugin-manager ([lazy-nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim))
  - notification-manager ([nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify))
  - code highlighting ([nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter))
  - shortcut key hint ([which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim))
- [batcat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
  - True color (256color + RGB)
  - <kbd>CTRL + A</kbd> Prefix
  - Mouse enabled
  - Vim-style pane navigation (<kbd>h</kbd><kbd>j</kbd><kbd>k</kbd><kbd>l</kbd>) and resizing (<kbd>H</kbd><kbd>J</kbd><kbd>K</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>)
  - Intuitive split keys: <kbd>|</kbd> horizontal, <kbd>-</kbd> vertical
  - <kbd>Alt + Arrow</kbd> switch panes, <kbd>Shift + Arrow</kbd> switch windows (no prefix needed)
  - Right-click context menus for pane/window/session management
  - Pane sync toggle (<kbd>S</kbd>), SYNC/ZOOM status indicators

## Get Started

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) and clone the repository if it is not already present.

```sh
[ -d ~/.oh-my-dotfiles ] || git clone https://github.com/Junyi-99/dotfiles.git ~/.oh-my-dotfiles
```

2. Add the shell entry points once, preserving existing configuration.

```sh
touch ~/.zshenv ~/.zshrc
grep -qxF 'source ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/zsh/zshenv' ~/.zshenv || echo 'source ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/zsh/zshenv' >> ~/.zshenv
grep -qxF 'source ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/zsh/zshrc' ~/.zshrc || echo 'source ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/zsh/zshrc' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Optionally add the local SSH configuration include.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/config
grep -qxF 'Include ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/ssh/*.local' ~/.ssh/config || echo 'Include ~/.oh-my-dotfiles/etc/ssh/*.local' >> ~/.ssh/config
```

4. Start a new shell and run `omd` to select packages.

```sh
exec zsh
omd
```

## omd

The native TUI uses Go 1.27.1, Bubble Tea v2.0.10, and Lip Gloss v2.0.6.
`go.mod` and `go.sum` pin the toolchain requirement and dependency versions.
The launcher builds into `cache/omd/omd` on first use and when Go sources change.
The Go toolchain and modules are downloaded automatically on the first build;
later launches use the cached binary. Shell startup loads `etc/omd/env.sh` and
starts a background update check at the configured interval.

```sh
omd                      # select packages in the TUI
omd install              # install saved selections
omd install --quiet      # log normal output; still report failures
omd env                  # regenerate shell integration without installing
omd update               # update the oh-my-dotfiles repository
omd auto-update          # run the scheduled update check
omd color                # detect terminal color support
omd version              # show the actual compiled versions
```

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ↑/↓ or j/k | Move; the list scrolls with the cursor |
| Tab or 1/2 | Switch between Basics and CLI Agents |
| Space / a | Select or deselect one package / the current group |
| m / g / f | Apply minimal / agent / full preset |
| s | Save selections and regenerate shell integration |
| Enter | Install selected tools and return to the shell with OMD environment loaded |
| r | Refresh installed status |
| u | Cycle auto-update frequency: off / daily / weekly / monthly |
| q / Esc | Quit and discard unsaved selections |

CLI Agents contains Claude Code and Codex CLI. Selections from the Python
version remain compatible; retired Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, and Kimi entries
are ignored and removed on the next save. Disabling a package removes its
shell integration, not its installed files.
Each package shows availability (`missing` / `installed`) and its selection
state. `Selected` means Enter will install it if missing; packages with shell
integration also enable that integration. `Unselected` means OMD skips its
installation and omits its integration. Neither state uninstalls existing files.
Select `Kitty config symlink` and press Enter to link `etc/kitty` to
`~/.config/kitty`. An existing config directory is moved to a timestamped
`.omd-backup-*` path first; an existing symlink to another location is preserved
and reported as a conflict.
Selecting Neovim also adds the `vim` → `nvim` shell alias when Neovim is installed.

Installers keep their interactive terminal prompts and log to
`cache/omd/install.log`. Failures return a nonzero status, including in quiet
mode. Selected Homebrew is installed first; missing prerequisites are reported
explicitly. Scheduled updates quietly fast-forward the oh-my-dotfiles repository.
They refuse uncommitted changes and unpushed commits; use `omd install` to install
enabled tools.
The default frequency is weekly; change it with `u` in the TUI and save with `s`.

`omd update` refuses uncommitted changes and unpushed commits. Use `--force`
only to deliberately discard tracked local changes and local commits.

### Development

The code follows [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go): named fields,
explicit errors, standard formatting, and small functions with concrete types.

```sh
go fmt ./cmd/omd
go test -race ./cmd/omd
go vet ./cmd/omd
go build -o cache/omd/omd ./cmd/omd
```
